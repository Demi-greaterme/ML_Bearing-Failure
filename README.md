# ML_Bearing-Failure
A machine learning model that predicts bearing faults in rotating shafts based on vibration data.
By extracting statistical features such as RMS, kurtosis, skewness, and crest factor from segmented vibration signals, the model can distinguish between normal and faulty bearing conditions, aiding in early fault detection and predictive maintenance.
